## Overview

This repo is a collect of my personal notes and scripts to help me learn and understand the basics of the data structures and algorithms with the help of github copilot.

How is copilot helping me learn?

Copilot is assisting me in writing the code and comprehending the ideas. I'm using Copilot to speed up the process of writing the code and comprehending the concepts, as well as to shorten the time it takes for me to research the best solution online.

### Learnings

Top techniques to approach and solve coding interview questions

1. Visualize the problem by drawing it out
2. Think about how you would solve the problem by hand
3. Come up with more examples
4. Break the question down into smaller independent parts
5. Apply common data structures and algorithms at the problem

How to optimize your approach or solution:

1. Identify the Best Theoretical Time Complexity of the solution
2. Identify overlapping and repeated computation
3. Try different data structures
4. Identify redundant work

How to optimize space complexity

1. Changing data in-place/overwriting input data
2. Change a data structure
